# Downloading the examples
If you have Git installed, navigate to the folder you intend to download the examples into.
Enter the following commands.
```
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/flyyee/css-backendcourse.git
git pull origin master
```
Alternatively, you can manually download the repo as a zip file (click on the green Code button > Download ZIP).

Choose the installer for your operating system.

# Other requirements

Make sure you have a suitable IDE for editing code. If you don't have one, I recommend VSCode.\
